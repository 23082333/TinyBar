# TinyBar

TinyBar uses Micronucleus V2.03 to boot into users' program.
 The Bootloader code can be found here:
https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus


For Windows user, make sure to install the correct libUSB driver. The driver could be found in the repository of the Bootloader. And for OSX and Linux users, no extra install is required.


There are some useful tools for TinyBar developing, which will be uploaded presently.
